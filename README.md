Problem
We are looking for a REST interface to a simple lottery system. The rules of the game are
described below.
Lottery Rules
You have a series of lines on a ticket with 3 numbers, each of which has a value of 0, 1, or 2.
For each ticket if the sum of the values on a line is 2, the result for that line is 10. Otherwise
if they are all the same, the result is 5. Otherwise so long as both 2nd and 3rd numbers are
different from the 1st, the result is 1. Otherwise the result is 0.
Implementation
Implement a REST interface to generate a ticket with n lines. Additionally we will need to
have the ability to check the status of lines on a ticket. We would like the lines sorted into
outcomes before being returned. It should be possible for a ticket to be amended with n
additional lines. Once the status of a ticket has been checked it should not be possible to
amend.
We would like tested, clean code to be returned.
Potential Solution
/ticket POST Create a ticket
/ticket GET Return list of tickets
/ticket/{id} GET Get individual ticket
/ticket/{id} PUT Amend ticket lines
/status/{id} PUT Retrieve status of ticket
